# Landing Page for an English Learning App 

## Screenshoot:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91353521/230518971-f3a24ad9-baab-4b38-9fca-4a0d2233e330.png)



This is a landing page I built to practice. The app doesn't really exist. It was one of my first projects, in which I used HTML and CSS with Bootstrap. 

The page is responsive, and I used bootstrap cards and a slider.
